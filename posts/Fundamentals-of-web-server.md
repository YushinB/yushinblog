# Static vs Dynamic Websites.
A static website is made up of webpages created using HTML, CSS and Javascript (all examples of web development languages). Each page on a static website is stored as a single HTML file , which is delivered directly from the server to the webpage exactly as is. This content essentially becomes a part of the design on your page, and won’t change unless the original HTML file is edited at a code level.

A dynamic websites is built using server side language and technology, dynamic websites allow for the content of each page to be delivered and displayed dynamically, or on-the-fly, according to user behavior or from user-generated content

## Apache Web Server.
Apache HTTP Server is a free and open-source web server that delivers web content through the internet. It is commonly referred to as Apache and after development, it quickly became the most popular HTTP client on the web.
